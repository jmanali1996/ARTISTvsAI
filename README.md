# ARTISTvsAI

## This app is developed to support the ARTIST vs AI campaign. This app is built on the foundational principles of neural style transfer developed by Mr Shafik Quoraishee [@squoraishee, https://github.com/squoraishee], with frontend design by me. It allows one to stylize an image and calculates the similarity percentage between two images.

_*The backend of the similarity percentage calculator is under development._

### Here is the video tutorial of the app which showcases its functioning and features:
